  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="conclusion">
    <p>Supabase and Render are really great if you want a backend without paying a lot of money. Supabase is awesome because it gives you a database that is ready to use, it also has login and user accounts, file storage, and even live updates that happen automatically. You can have a full backend working in just a few minutes without having to worry about all the complicated stuff that usually comes with servers. Render is really cool too because it lets you put your apps, APIs, scheduled tasks, and websites online very easily, and it also has a free plan that is pretty generous. You do not need to deal with servers or hard setup steps you just put your code there and it works. Both of them together make building websites or apps much faster and easier, and they let you focus on making your app fun and useful instead of stressing about the backend.</p>
