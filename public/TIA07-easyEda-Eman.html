<h1 align="center">My EasyEDA YouTube Experience</h1>

<p>
    I followed this video tutorial to learn about EasyEDA:  
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjPNYMRA0m8&list=PLbKMtVtYbdPMZfzGuvTdc0MWKrFvU4nsu&index=2" target="_blank">
        EasyEDA Tutorial Video on YouTube
    </a>
</p>

<h2>What I Learned From the Video</h2>
<p>
    The video introduced me to <b>EasyEDA</b>, a web-based tool for designing and simulating circuits.  
    I learned how to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a schematic diagram with electronic components.</li>
    <li>Connect components together to make a working circuit.</li>
    <li>Switch from schematic view to PCB layout view.</li>
    <li>Design the physical layout of a circuit board (PCB).</li>
    <li>Prepare the project to be manufactured by JLCPCB.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Watching the tutorial gave me hands-on knowledge of how electronic projects go from an idea → schematic → PCB → real product.
</p>

<h2>About JLCPCB</h2>
<p>
    <b>JLCPCB</b> is a major PCB manufacturer. It works directly with EasyEDA, so after finishing my design in the video, I could 
    see how simple it is to order the board online. JLCPCB is known for low-cost and high-quality PCB production.
</p>

<h2>About EasyEDA</h2>
<p>
    <b>EasyEDA</b> is a free online circuit design tool. The video showed me how convenient it is because everything is in one place: 
    schematic capture, simulation, PCB layout, and ordering. This makes it easier for beginners and professionals to design electronics.

<h2>RAKWIRELESS RAK3112 Module</h2>
<p>
    Mr. Ellis also introduced the <b>RAKWIRELESS RAK3112</b> module. It is a LoRaWAN communication device used in 
    <b>IoT (Internet of Things)</b> projects. The module allows long-distance, low-power wireless communication.  
    Applications include smart farming, smart cities, and environmental monitoring.
